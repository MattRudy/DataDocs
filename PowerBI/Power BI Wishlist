I've had a personal wishlist for years while using Power BI, and continue to watch the features gradually get added over time.
This file serves to track them and document resolutions.

Resolution Types:
ET - External Tool (This is not addressed in the core product)
PR - Partially Resolved (There is a partial solution to the issue)


#1 - Ability to identify and remove unused columns and measures from a dataset, including linked reports if it's a shared dataset.
  ET - The BPA tool inside Tabular Editor can identify columns and measure not used within that dataset (but not linked reports) and they can be removed manually.

#2 - Ability to branch-and-merge Power BI (pbix) files

(More coming soon)
